## IoT system for server monitoring

The project to be developed below proposes a device for monitoring and configuration of air conditioning equipment installed in the server room automatically or remotely through access to a web page.  The project initiative has been proposed due to the operational complications that the manual operation of the equipment usually means to the staff of the Institute (LANIA). In the event of a power failure, the servers start up automatically; however, the Minispits do not have this facility.
